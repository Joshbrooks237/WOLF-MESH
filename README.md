# 🐺 WOLFY'S MESH CONCERT 🐺

*A Cinematic Simulation of 17,000 Audience Nodes Creating a Synchronized Audio-Visual Experience*

---

## 🎭 What Is This?

Wolfy is a playful yet technically sophisticated simulation of a mesh-network-powered concert. Imagine 17,000 audience members, each with a phone that can:
- Flash lights in synchronized patterns
- Play musical tones
- Communicate with nearby phones
- Make AI-driven decisions about participation

Together, they create a living, breathing audiovisual orchestra, guided by **Wolfy** — an AI orchestrator — and narrated by **Ryan Gosling** (in text form, with all the contemplative gravitas you'd expect).

---

## 🎵 The Experience

### Musical Themes
- **Blade Runner** motifs (Vangelis-inspired, neon-blue aesthetic)
- **Peter and the Wolf** orchestral themes:
  - Bird (flute, yellow lights)
  - Duck (oboe, blue lights)
  - Cat (clarinet, purple lights)
  - Wolf (French horns, deep red lights)
  - Hunters (drums, orange lights)

### Technical Marvel
- **17,000 simulated nodes** with realistic spatial distribution
- **Mesh networking** with signal strength and latency simulation
- **AI-driven gateway selection** and leadership rotation
- **Distributed decision-making** — nodes decide whether to participate
- **Real-time synchronization** across the network with propagation delays

### Cinematic Flair
- **Ryan Gosling narration** throughout the experience
- **Beautiful visualizations** including:
  - Network topology diagrams
  - Participation heatmaps (spatial and temporal)
  - Gateway network analysis
  - Statistical dashboards
- **Event logging** for every beat, theme change, and leadership rotation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

**Automated Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

**Manual Setup**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Concert

**First, activate your virtual environment:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

**Option 1: Interactive Mode** (Recommended first experience)
```bash
python run_wolfy_concert.py
```
You'll get a menu to choose:
1. Full Experience (17,000 nodes, 60 seconds)
2. Quick Demo (5,000 nodes, 30 seconds)
3. Custom settings
4. Export narration script only

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
# Quick demo
python run_wolfy_concert.py --quick

# Full experience without narration
python run_wolfy_concert.py --no-narration

# Just run the core simulation
python wolfy_mesh_concert.py
```

## 🎨 Key Features

### 1. Mesh Network Simulation
- **Spatial clustering** mimicking real venue sections
- **Proximity-based connections** (Bluetooth/WiFi range ~8 meters)
- **Signal strength** affecting connection quality
- **Latency modeling** for realistic propagation

### 2. AI Orchestration
- **Gateway selection** based on:
  - Network centrality (number of neighbors)
  - Battery levels
  - Leadership score (inherent node personality)
- **Leadership rotation** every 16 beats to balance load
- **Participation decisions** based on:
  - Current energy level of the performance
  - Node personality traits
  - Battery constraints

### 3. Musical Synchronization
- **Beat propagation** from conductor → gateways → neighboring nodes
- **Phase offsets** creating wave effects across the crowd
- **Theme-specific patterns**:
  - Colors (RGB values)
  - Light frequencies (Hz)
  - Tone patterns (frequency, duration, waveform)

### 4. Visualizations
- **Network diagrams** showing nodes, connections, and states
- **Heatmaps** revealing participation hotspots
- **Time-series analysis** of network activity
- **Statistical dashboards** with multiple views

### 5. Ryan Gosling Narration
Because every technically impressive simulation deserves a moody, contemplative voice-over about connection, technology, and what it means to be human in a mesh network.

## 💡 Enhancement Ideas

The simulation includes suggestions for:
- **Aesthetic improvements**: Dynamic color palettes, advanced strobe patterns, spatial audio
- **Technical upgrades**: Real Bluetooth Mesh, genetic algorithms, predictive routing

## 🎬 The Ryan Gosling Experience

Sample narration:

> *"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe... Seventeen thousand phones, synchronized in the dark. Each one... a node. Each node... a voice. Together, they become something more."*

The narration system includes:
- **Beat-synchronized lines** appearing at key moments
- **Opening and closing monologues**
- **Spontaneous observations** about the network
- **Full script export** for reading

## 🐺 About Wolfy

Wolfy is the AI orchestrator at the heart of the mesh concert. She:
- Coordinates 17,000 nodes without central control
- Makes real-time decisions about network topology
- Balances aesthetics with technical constraints
- Brings Wolf-energy to distributed systems

She believes in:
- **Democratic networks** (rotating leadership)
- **Consent-based features** (optional strobe effects)
- **Organic emergence** (beauty from simple rules)
- **Connection** over control

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

This is a simulation, but the concepts are real:
- **Deploy at actual concerts** with audience phones
- **Create city-wide art installations**
- **Teach networking concepts** in an engaging way
- **Pioneer new forms of collective expression**

The technology exists. The vision is here. Now we just need 17,000 people willing to sync their phones for art.
