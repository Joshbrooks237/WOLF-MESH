## 🎭 The Ryan Gosling Touch

Sample narration highlights:

> "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe... Seventeen thousand phones, synchronized in the dark."

> "And then... the wolf arrives. Deep tones. Red lights bleeding through the crowd. This is what they came for."

> "Seventeen thousand nodes. One consciousness. This is what connection looks like."

The narration system adds emotional depth to technical excellence, making the simulation feel like an art piece, not just a technical demo.
